# Recreating the React-Native-Router-Flux documentation

## Motivation

I'm a user of this library and I really like it. I never went to anything else. But i've come to the conclusion the power of this library can be
further enhanced by having an awesome documentation.

The documentation by itself is cool, the API configuration is fine, but it lacks the step by step way of getting users to really get into it.
Many times i've stumbled upon a problem while using RNRF and the documentation couldn't help me, even through these were basic problems.
We can really make it a great library with a great documentation. Let's build it together ! Here's a guideline on how to contribute.

## Plan
### Introduction

The Introduction has been rewrited to be more concise and appealing. The first things users view are the first 10 lines, they have to be the
best first 10 lines of their life.
With that in mind :
- we should tell the user what are all the benefits of this library in the shortest way and easiest way possible
- we don't need to talk about details or about implementation. This is for the how to. A Project manager who never heard about RN should be able to understand it.

### Who uses it ?

I believe this is the best place to put it. It gives more interest to the user and invite him to stay since this
project is widely used by business apps. It's just a quick tour, it takes 5 seconds to read it.

### Getting Started

The plan must me really short by itself, but not too short to avoid thinking this is a tiny library. There should
be a mix between these. It must be composed of really short titles. It must focus on really important and widely
used idioms, ideas or features about navigation on mobile phone. As much as possible we will also focus on performance
while writing these tutorials. It's really easy to mess it up.

## About the way to work

### Comments

Usually comments will be in italic. These point require people who can help to put a description here or to let a way to enhance this part of the documentation.
Exemple : *[complete and appealing description required]*

#### Complete and appealing description required

This mention *[completed and appealing description required]* appears on the introduction mainly. It aims to give a quick text to
describe the related content with as few words as possible, and as easy as possible. If you read it to your cat, it must understand.
